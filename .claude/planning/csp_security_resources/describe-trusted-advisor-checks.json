CloudTrail provides increased visibility into activity in your AWS account by recording information about AWS API calls made on the account. You can use these logs to determine, for example, what actions a particular user has taken during a specified time period or which users have taken actions on a particular resource during a specified time period. Because CloudTrail delivers log files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, CloudTrail must have write permissions for the bucket. If a trail applies to all regions (the default when creating a new trail), the trail appears multiple times in the Trusted Advisor report.<br /><br /><h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Alert Criteria</h4><br/>Yellow: CloudTrail reports log delivery errors for a trail.<br/>Red: A trail has not been created for a region, or logging is turned off for a trail.<br/><br/><h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Recommended Action</h4><br/>To create a trail and start logging from the console, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home\" target=\"_blank\">AWS CloudTrail console</a>. <br/>To start logging, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_using_cli.html#stopstartclil\" target=\"_blank\">Stopping and Starting Logging for a Trail</a>. <br/>If you receive log delivery errors, check to make sure that the bucket exists and that the necessary policy is attached to the bucket; see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_bucket_policy.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon S3 Bucket Policy</a>.<br/><br/><h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Additional Resources</h4><br /><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/whatisawscloudtrail.html\" target=\"_blank\">AWS CloudTrail User Guide</a><br/><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_supported_regions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Supported Regions</a><br/><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_supported_services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Supported Services</a>",

Replication lag occurs when the asynchronous updates made to the read replica cannot keep up with the updates happening on the primary database instance. In the event of a failure to the primary instance, data could be missing from the read replica if the ReplicaLag is above an operationally reasonable threshold.<br><br><b>Alert Criteria</b><br>Red: ReplicaLag metric exceeded 60 seconds at least once during the week.<br>Yellow: ReplicaLag metric exceeded 10 seconds at least once during the week.<br>Green: ReplicaLag is less than 10 seconds.<br><br><b>Recommended Action</b><br>There are several possible causes for ReplicaLag to increase beyond operationally safe levels.  For example, it can be caused by recently replaced/launched replica instances from older backups and these replicas requiring substantial time to catch-up to the primary database instance and live transactions. This ReplicaLag may dwindle over time as catch-up occurs. Another example could be that the transaction velocity able to be achieved on the primary database instance is higher than the replication process or replica infrastructure is able to match. This ReplicaLag may grow over time as replication fails to keep pace with the primary database performance.  Finally, the workload may be bursty throughout different periods of the day/month/etc. that result in occasional ReplicaLag to fall behind.  Your team should investigate which possible root cause has contributed to high ReplicaLag for the database, and possibly change the database instance type or other characteristics of the workload to ensure data continuity on the replica matches your requirements.<br><br><b></b><b>Additional Resources</b><br><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PostgreSQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with read replicas for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a><br><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with MySQL replication in Amazon RDS</a><br><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_MySQL.Replication.ReadReplicas.html\" target=\"_blank\">Working with MySQL read replicas</a>",

If a DB instance has not had a connection for a prolonged period of time, you can delete the instance to reduce costs. If persistent storage is needed for data on the instance, you can use lower-cost options such as taking and retaining a DB snapshot. Manually created DB snapshots are retained until you delete them.<br> <br> <h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Alert Criteria</h4><br> Yellow: An active DB instance has not had a connection in the last 7 days.<br> <br> <h4 class='headerBodyStyle'>Recommended Action</h4><br> Consider taking a snapshot of the idle DB instance and then either stopping it or deleting it. Stopping the DB instance removes some of the costs for it, but does not remove storage costs. A stopped instance keeps all automated backups based upon the configured retention period. Stopping a DB instance usually incurs additional costs when compared to deleting the instance and then retaining only the final snapshot.

Customers should enable access logging to perform security audits or analyze user behavior and usage patterns.<br><br>When logging is initially enabled, the configuration is automatically validated. However, future modifications can result in logging failures. Please note that currently this check doesn’t examine Amazon S3 bucket write permissions.<br><h4 class=\"headerBodyStyle\">Alert Criteria</h4>Yellow: The bucket does not have server access logging enabled.<br>Yellow: The target bucket permissions do not include the root account, so Trusted Advisor cannot check it.<br>Red: The target bucket does not exist.<br>Red: The target bucket and the source bucket have different owners.<br>Green: Bucket has server access logging enabled and the target exists<h4 class=\"headerBodyStyle\">Recommended Action</h4>Enable server access logging for all relevant S3 buckets. Server access logs provide an audit trail that can be used to understand bucket access patterns and investigate suspicious activity. Enabling logging on all applicable buckets will improve visibility into access events across your S3 environment. See Enabling Logging Using the Console and Enabling Logging Programmatically.<br><br>If the target bucket permissions do not include the root account and you want Trusted Advisor to check the logging status, add the root account as a grantee. See Editing Bucket Permissions.<br><br>If the target bucket does not exist, select an existing bucket as a target or create a new one and select it. See Managing Bucket Logging.<br><br>If the target and source have different owners, change the target bucket to one that has the same owner as the source bucket.
