        "A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource, and it consists of a key and an optional value. You can create tags to \n            categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Tags can help you identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. \n            Tagging also helps you track accountable resource owners for actions and notifications. When you use tagging, you can implement attribute-based \n            access control (ABAC) as an authorization strategy, which defines permissions based on tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users or roles) \n            and to AWS resources. You can create a single ABAC policy or a separate set of policies for your IAM principals. You can design these ABAC \n            policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the resource tag. For more information, seeWhat is ABAC for AWS?in theIAM User Guide.",
        "Donât add personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. Tags are accessible \n                to many AWS services, including AWS Billing. For more tagging best practices, seeTagging your AWS resourcesin theAWS General Reference.",

Data records are stored in shards in your stream temporarily. The time period from when a record is added to when it is \nno longer accessible is called the retention period. Kinesis Data Streams almost immediately makes records older than the new retention \nperiod inaccessible after decreasing the retention period. For example, changing the retention period from 24 hours to 48 hours \nmeans that records added to the stream 23 hours 55 minutes prior are still available after 24 hours.",

        "A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS resource, and it consists of a key and an optional value. You can create tags to \n            categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Tags can help you identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. \n            Tagging also helps you track accountable resource owners for actions and notifications. When you use tagging, you can implement attribute-based \n            access control (ABAC) as an authorization strategy, which defines permissions based on tags. You can attach tags to IAM entities (users or roles) \n            and to AWS resources. You can create a single ABAC policy or a separate set of policies for your IAM principals. You can design these ABAC \n            policies to allow operations when the principal's tag matches the resource tag. For more information, seeWhat is ABAC for AWS?in theIAM User Guide.",
        "Donât add personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. Tags are accessible \n                to many AWS services, including AWS Billing. For more tagging best practices, seeTagging your AWS resourcesin theAWS General Reference.",
